# BASH_SOURCE so that we find the fuchsia_dir enclosing the current working
# directory instead of the one containing this file in case the user has
# multiple source trees and is picking up this file from another one.
#
# NOTE: The FUCHSIA_DIR environment variable is ignored here because it
# could point to a different Fuchsia checkout in some developer setups.
#
# This logic is replicated in //scripts/fx, //scripts/hermetic_env,
# //scripts/zsh_completion/_fx, and //src/developer/ffx/scripts. For
# consistency, copy any changes here to those files as well.
