// Page provider implementation that talks to a userspace pager service.
//
// The lifecycle of this class is a little complicated because the pager dispatcher's port
// potentially has an unmanaged reference to the PageSource that contains the PagerProxy through
// packet_. Because of this, we need to ensure that the last RefPtr to the PageSource isn't released
// too early when the pager dispatcher gets closed. Normally, the dispatcher can retain its
// reference to the PageSource until the port frees its reference to packet_ (through the
// PortAllocator). However, if the dispatcher is destroyed, if we can't revoke the port's reference
// to packet_, then we end up making the PagerProxy keep a reference to the containing PageSource
// until the packet is freed.
