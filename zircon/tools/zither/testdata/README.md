# Zither golden test cases

Each directory here represents a golden test case across the various backends.
The directory structure follows the following organization:
```
<case name>/
    <input FIDL files, defining library `test.${case name}`>

    goldens/
        <backend name>/
            <the files generated by this backend for the associated library>
```
