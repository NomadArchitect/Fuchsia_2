This directory holds all of the license patterns used in check-licenses.

These license patterns are organized using the documentation on fuchsia.dev:
https://fuchsia.dev/fuchsia-src/contribute/governance/policy/open-source-licensing-policies

**approved_production**: These license patterns are approved for use in
production targets. License patterns in this category are also allowed in
development targets.

**approved_development**: These license patterns are only approved for use in
development targets.

**reciprocal**: Not allowed for use.

**restricted**: Not allowed for use.

**exception**: There are many license types that are not explicitly allowed or
disallowed in the fuchsia.dev documentation. Those licenses go here and will
require explicit exceptions for use. They can be moved to one of the other
categories depending on OSRBs recommendation.
