# Build landmines

A "landmine" is used to indicate to the build that a particular commit should
invalidate incremental builds on either side of the change, acting as a sort of
fence. `fx build` and `fint build` both call `check_landmines.py` which will
clobber the build if it detects a difference between the set of landmines which
was used for a particular build and those which are generated by the current
checkout.

## Adding a new landmine

**Note: Adding a new build landmine will clobber any existing existing
incremental caches, both on builders and on developer machines. As a result of
the widespread impact, new landmines must be approved by the build team after
investigating other options for making a change.**

Add a new `print("...")` statement to the `print_landmines` function in
`get_landmines.py`, including a bug number and short explanation as to why
it's needed.
