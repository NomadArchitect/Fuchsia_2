# Create a product assembly config file from the lists of packages and config
# passed into the template.
#
# This template specifically converts lists of labels for fuchsia_package() and
# prebuilt_package() into the lists of output paths needed.  This keeps the
# contract about where those two templates place the package manifest internal
# to fuchsia.git.
#
# As outputs, this creates:
#
#  outputs = [
#       "${target_out_dir}/${target_name}/product_assembly_config.json"
#  ]
#
#
# Arguments:
#
#   Product-specified Package Sets:
#    These are optional lists of targets that produce Fuchsia Packages.  These
#    are NOT walked for metadata, but must be the exact desired package-creating
#    targets.
#
#   base_packages [optional]
#     [list, GN scopes] A list of GN scopes that hold the information for a
#     product-provided package to place into the base set. The scope must have a
#     'package_target' field pointing to the GN target of the fuchsia_package.
#
#   base_driver_packages (optional)
#     [list, GN scopes] A list of GN scopes that hold the driver packages to
#     include in the base package set. Packages listed here should not be
#     listed in the base_packages and will be included automatically in
#     the base package set as driver packages. The scope must have a
#     `package_target` field pointing to the GN target of the fuchsia_package,
#     and `driver_components` field containing a list of relative paths to
#     driver components provided by the package, e.g. "meta/driver.cm"
#
#   cache_packages [optional]
#     [list, GN scopes] A list of GN scopes that hold the information for a
#     product-provided package to place into the cache set. The scope must have a
#     'package_target' field pointing to the GN target of the fuchsia_package.
#
#   platform [optional]
#   [scope] This is the platform configuration scope
#
#   product [optional]
#   [scope] This is the product configuration scope
#
# GN Usual:
#   testonly
#   visibility
