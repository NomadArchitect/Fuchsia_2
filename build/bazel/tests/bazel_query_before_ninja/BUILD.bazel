# A silly example that demonstrate how it is possible to perform Bazel queries
# before a full Ninja build. The only requirement is for the Bazel workspace
# to be setup properly, which can be done with `fx build bazel_workspace`
#
# Note that a Bazel *build* or *run* command will not work before Ninja
# outputs are properly generated, which can be enforced with
# `fx build build/bazel:legacy_ninja_build_outputs`.
