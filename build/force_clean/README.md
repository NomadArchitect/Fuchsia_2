# Build force_clean

A "clean build fence" is used to indicate to the build that a particular commit
should invalidate incremental builds on either side of the change. `fx build`
and `fint build` both call `force_clean_if_needed.py` which will clobber the
build if it detects a difference between the set of fences which was used for a
particular build and those which are generated by the current checkout.

## Adding a new fence

**Note: Adding a new fence will clobber any existing existing incremental
caches, both on builders and on developer machines. As a result of the
widespread impact, new fences must be approved by the build team after
investigating other options for making a change.**

Add a new `print("...")` statement to the `print_fences` function in
`get_fences.py`, including a bug number and short explanation as to why
it's needed.
