# Defines a Fuchsia component.
# See: https://fuchsia.dev/fuchsia-src/development/components/build
#
# A component is defined by a component manifest.
# Component manifests typically reference files in the package that they are
# distributed in. Therefore a component can also have dependencies on
# `resource()`, such that any package that depends on the component # will
# also include that resource.
#
# A component is launched by a URL.
# See: https://fuchsia.dev/fuchsia-src/glossary#component_url
#
# A component's URL is a function of the name of a package that includes it,
# and the path within that package to the component's manifest. For instance if
# you defined the following:
# ```
# executable("my_program") {
#   ...
# }
#
# fuchsia_component("my-component") {
#   manifest = "manifest.cml"
#   deps = [ ":my_program" ]
# }
#
# fuchsia_package("my-package") {
#   deps = [ ":my-component" ]
# }
# ```
# The component above will have the following launch URL:
# `fuchsia-pkg://fuchsia.com/my-package#meta/my-component.cm`
#
# Since the component depends on the executable target, the binary produced by
# the executable will be packaged with the manifest. Therefore the manifest
# author can reference the path `bin/my_program`.
#
# Components may depend on any number of `resource()` targets to ensure that
# any `fuchsia_package()` that includes them will include the same resources.
#
# ```
# resource("my_file") {
#   sources = [ "my_file.txt" ]
#   outputs = [ "data/{{source_file_part}}" ]
# }
#
# fuchsia_component("my-component") {
#   deps = [ ":my_file" ]
#   ...
# }
# ```
#
# The component defined above will be able to read my_file.txt under the path
# "/pkg/data/my_file.txt" in its sandbox.
#
# Parameters
#
#   manifest (required)
#     The component manifest.
#     Type: path
#
#   component_name (optional)
#     The name of the component.
#     Type: string
#     Default: target_name
#
#   check_references (optional)
#     Check component manifest references (e.g. "program.binary") against
#     package manifest.
#     Type: boolean
#     Default: true
#
#   restricted_features (optional)
#     The set of restricted CML features to allow. Only applicable to v2 components.
#     The set of features is allowlisted here: //tools/cmc/build/restricted_features/BUILD.gn
#     where each feature name is represented by a group of the same name.
#     Type: list of strings
#     Default: []
#
#   experimental_force_runner (optional)
#     Set the --experimental-force-runner flag to the given value.
#     This flag is experimental and may be removed without warning.
