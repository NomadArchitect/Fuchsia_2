//! Job Handling Support
//!
//! # Summary
//!
//! [Jobs] are basic units of work that interfaces in the setting service can specify. In addition
//! to the workload, [Job] definitions also capture information about how the work should be
//! handled. For example, a Job can specify that it would like to run in sequence within a set of
//! similar [Jobs](Job). This behavior is captured by the [Job's](Job) [ExecutionType].
//!
//! Sources are streams that provide jobs from a given source. The lifetime of (Jobs)[Job] produced
//! by a source are bound to the source's lifetime. The end of a source stream will lead to any
//! in-flight and pending jobs being cancelled.
//!
//! Job Manager is responsible for managing sources and the jobs they produce. The manager
//! associates and maintains any supporting data for jobs, such as caches.
