//! Job Management Support
//!
//! # Summary
//!
//! The manager mod defines entities for managing [Job] sources and controlling the execution of
//! pending [workloads](crate::job::Workload) contained in those [Jobs](Job). [Manager] provides a
//! concrete implementation of a [Job] processor. Outside clients send [Job] sources to the
//! [Manager] over the [MessageHub](crate::message::message_hub::MessageHub). In turn, the [Manager]
//! will process each received source for new [Jobs](Job) and provide the necessary backing, such as
//! caches, to support executing the [Job].
