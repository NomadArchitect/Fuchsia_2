                    emulator will launch with fuchsia sdk files fetched from
                    gcs. To find the latest version run `gsutil cat

  --port-map        host port mapping for user-networking mode. This flag will
                    be ignored if --tuntap is used. If not specified, an ssh
                    port on host will be randomly picked and forwarded. ex:

                    for --nointeractive mode. Default is a temp file that is
                    deleted after `fvdl` exits. Specify this flag if you plan to
                    use the `kill` subcommand.

                    required for bringup image. No local services such as
                    package_server will be running in this mode.
  --nopackageserver bool, disable automatically launching package server.
  --packages-to-serve

                    file path to store package server log. Default is a stdout.
                    Requires --nopackageserver=false
  --amber-unpack-root
                    path to unpack archived_package downloaded from GCS. This
                    only applies when fvdl is downloading images files from GCS
                    (ex: --gcs-bucket, --sdk-verion, --image-name flags are
                    specified). If not specified, a temporary path will be used.
  --envs            environment variables for emulator. The argument can be
                    repeated for multiple times to add multiple arguments. If
                    not specified, only the default environment variables
                    (DISPLAY) will be set to run the emulator.
  --noacceleration  bool, disable acceleration using KVM on Linux and HVF on
                    macOS.
  --package-server-port
                    int, port to an existing package server running on the host.
