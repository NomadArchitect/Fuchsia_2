# blobfs-compression

```none {: style="white-space: break-spaces;" .devsite-disable-click-to-copy}

Usage: blobfs-compression [--option1=value --option2 ...]

The tool will output the maximum possible compressed file size using the exact same 
compression implementation in blobfs. The merkle tree used here is a non-compact merkle 
tree as it contributes to a bigger size than a compact merkle tree.

```

__Options:__

```none {: style="white-space: break-spaces;" .devsite-disable-click-to-copy}

--source_file=/path/to/file
    (required) the file to be compressed.
--compressed_file=/path/to/file
    (optional) the compressed file output path (override if existing). This file contains compressed bytes and additional 0x00 padding bytes at the end of the output file to ensure compressed file size matches the size in stdout.
--disable_size_alignment
    not align the final compressed output size with block size.
--help
    print this usage message.
--verbose
    show debugging information.
```
