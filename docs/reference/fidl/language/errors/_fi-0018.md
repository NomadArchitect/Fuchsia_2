### fi-0018: Ordinals must start at 1 {#fi-0018}

Neither `table` nor `union` member ordinals are allowed to be 0:

<<label/_bad.md>>

```fidl
{% includecode gerrit_repo="fuchsia/fuchsia" gerrit_path="tools/fidl/fidlc/errors/bad/fi-0018.test.fidl" exclude_regexp="//.*" %}
```

Instead, numbering should start from 1:

<<label/_good.md>>

```fidl
{% includecode gerrit_repo="fuchsia/fuchsia" gerrit_path="tools/fidl/fidlc/errors/good/fi-0018.test.fidl" exclude_regexp="//.*" %}
```

This is so because a value of 0 is used to indicate an absent field on the wire
when encoding tables. Using this value as an ordinal would create an ambiguity
in the FIDL wire format: is this an absent table field, or a present one of
ordinal 0? n the case of unions, 0 indicates an absent union, which similarly
creates an ambiguity between "null union" and "a present union of ordinal zero".
