## fi-0067: Bits member must be power of two {#fi-0067}

The values of all members in a `bits` declaration must not be any number that is
not a power of two:

{% include "docs/reference/fidl/language/error-catalog/label/_bad.md" %}

```fidl
{% includecode gerrit_repo="fuchsia/fuchsia" gerrit_path="tools/fidl/fidlc/tests/fidl/bad/bits_non_power_of_two.test.fidl" exclude_regexp="//.*" %}
```

Instead, member values should always be powers of two:

{% include "docs/reference/fidl/language/error-catalog/label/_good.md" %}

```fidl
{% includecode gerrit_repo="fuchsia/fuchsia" gerrit_path="tools/fidl/fidlc/tests/fidl/good/simple_bits.test.fidl" exclude_regexp="//.*" %}
```

An easy way to avoid getting tripped up by this restriction is to just use bit
masks, rather than decimal numbers, for bit member values:

{% include "docs/reference/fidl/language/error-catalog/label/_good.md" %}

```fidl
{% includecode gerrit_repo="fuchsia/fuchsia" gerrit_path="tools/fidl/fidlc/tests/fidl/good/masked_bits.test.fidl" exclude_regexp="//.*" %}
```

The `bits` construct represents a [bit array][wiki-bit-array]. This is the most
memory-efficient way to represent a sequence of boolean flags. Because each
member of the `bits` declaration is mapped to a specific bit of its underlying
memory, the values used for that mapping must clearly identify a specific bit in
an unsigned integer to assign to.
