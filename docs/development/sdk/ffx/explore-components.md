# ffx component explore

`ffx component explore` is an ffx plugin that allows you to interactively explore
the internals of fuchsia components. Unlike `fx shell`, the namespace only contains
your component's incoming & outgoing capabilities. This restriction means you're able
to explore in an environment almost identical to what your component sees.

Currently, it launches a [Dash](#what_is_dash) process scoped to your component.
In this process:

+   You have a similar command-line experience to `fx shell`.
+   You can use familiar tools such as `ls`, `cat` and `grep`.
+   You can explore your component's incoming and outgoing capabilities.

Note: The filesystem used in `Dash` is not POSIX-compliant. Capabilities are
presented as files and directories to aid in exploration.

## Getting started

1.  Ensure your branch is synced to tip-of-tree with `jiri update`.

1.  Ensure that you are building an engineering product like `core`, `terminal`
    or `workstation_eng`.

1.  Start up an emulator and/or connect to a device.

1.  Choose a component moniker and start exploring:

    ```none
    > ffx component explore /bootstrap/archivist
    $ ls
    exposed
    ns
    out
    runtime
    svc
    ```

    See [what is the namespace root](#what_is_root) for more details on these
    directories.

## How do I...

For the following sections, we use the `/bootstrap/archivist` moniker. This
should be replaced with the moniker of your component.

### Explore the capabilities available to my component?

The `/ns` directory contains the component's namespace, exactly as your
component would see it.

```none
> ffx component explore /bootstrap/archivist
$ cd ns
$ ls
pkg
data
svc
$ cd data
$ ls
logs.txt
$ mv logs.txt logs2.txt
$ mkdir captures
```

If you want the shell namespace to match the component namespace, use
the `-l`/`--layout` flag.

```none
> ffx component explore /bootstrap/archvisit -l namespace
$ ls
pkg
data
svc
```

### Explore the capabilities exposed by my component?

The `/exposed` directory contains the capabilities exposed from your component
to its parent.

```none
> ffx component explore /bootstrap/archivist
$ cd exposed
$ ls
fuchsia.foo.bar.MyProtocol
```

### Explore the capabilities my component is serving?

If a component is running, the `/out` directory contains all the capabilities
currently served by it.

```none
> ffx component explore /bootstrap/archivist
$ cd out
$ ls
diagnostics
svc
$ cd svc
$ ls
fuchsia.foo.bar.MyProtocol
```

### Explore debug runtime data about my component?

If your component is running, the `/runtime` directory contains debug
information provided by the component runner.

```none
> ffx component explore /bootstrap/archivist
$ cd runtime/elf
$ ls
args
process_id
job_id
$ cat process_id
7352
```

### Run a command non-interactively?

Use the `-c`/`--command` flag to run a command in the shell non-interactively and receive
its stdout, stderr and exit code.

```none
> ffx component explore /bootstrap/archivist -c "cat /runtime/elf/process_id"
2542
```

### Run a command-line tool I built for my component?

This isn't supported yet, but we're working on it. Soon, we will add support for
running custom command-line tools that can use your component's namespace
capabilities.

## FAQ

### What is Dash?

[Dash]{:.external} is the command interpreter used in `fx shell`, serial
console, terminal windows, virtcon, etc. We are using it as the experience for
`ffx component explore` because it is familiar and serves as a good starting
point for `cd`-ing and `ls`-ing around to explore your component.

### Why can't I see child components from the parent?

We do not allow accessing child components directly from the parent. Using
knowledge of the component topology to access a child component's capabilities
made tools brittle in `fx shell`. Tools used to keep hard-coded paths to
`/hub-v2` which encoded knowledge about the system topology.

As an alternative, we recommend:

+   explicitly routing capabilities from the child to the parent component.
+   exploring the child component itself.

### How is this different from ffx component run?

`ffx component run` creates and then starts a component in a specified
collection within the component topology. It offers no interactive capabilities.
`ffx component explore` allows exploring any existing component in the topology
interactively. You can use `ffx component explore` to learn about a component
you just created using `ffx component run`.

### What is the namespace root (/) in ffx component explore? {: #what_is_root}

By default, `ffx component explore` creates a virtual file system at the namespace
root that contains the following directories:

| Directory  | Description                                                   |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `/.dash`   | contains binaries needed by `Dash`.                           |
| `/exposed` | contains all exposed capabilities.                            |
| `/ns`      | contains the component's namespace, exactly as your component |
:            : would see it.                                                 :
| `/svc`     | contains capabilities needed by `Dash`.                       |

If your component is running, the following directories are also present:

Directory  | Description
---------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------
`/out`     | contains all capabilities currently being served by the component.
`/runtime` | contains debug information served by the componentâ€™s runner.

If the `--layout namespace` flag is set, then the shell's namespace will match
the component's namespace.

### Can I access Zircon handles or make FIDL calls via the Dash shell?

That is not supported directly from the command interpreter.
