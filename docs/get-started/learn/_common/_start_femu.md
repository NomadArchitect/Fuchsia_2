### Start the emulator

If you do not already have an instance running, start the emulator:

```posix-terminal
ffx emu start --headless
```

When startup is complete, the emulator prints the following message and
returns:

```none {:.devsite-disable-click-to-copy}
Logging to "{{ '<var>' }}$HOME{{ '</var>' }}/.local/share/Fuchsia/ffx/emu/instances/fuchsia-emulator/emulator.log"
Waiting for Fuchsia to start (up to 60 seconds)........
Emulator is ready.
```
