# Get started with Fuchsia

Welcome to Fuchsia!

This guide provides instructions on how to download the Fuchsia source code,
build a Fuchsia system image, and start Fuchsia on an emulator.

Note: If you want to run Fuchsia on a hardware device, see
[Install Fuchsia on a device](/docs/development/hardware/paving.md) after
completing Step 2 below.
