# Get started with the Fuchsia SDK

This guide provides step-by-step instructions on setting up the
Fuchsia SDK development environment on your host machine. The guide then walks
you through the basic workflows of building, running, debugging, and testing
Fuchsia components using the [Fuchsia SDK][using-the-sdk].

Important: The Fuchsia SDK is in active development. At the moment, Fuchsia
does not support general public usage of the Fuchsia SDK. The APIs in the
SDK are subject to change without notice.

Complete the following sections:

1. [Prerequisites](#prerequisites)
1. [Clone the SDK samples repository](#clone-the-sdk-samples-repository)
1. [Start the emulator](#start-the-emulator)
1. [Build and run the sample component](#build-and-run-the-sample-component)
1. [View symbolized logs](#view-symbolized-logs)
1. [Debug the sample component](#debug-the-sample-component)
1. [Inspect components](#inspect-components)
1. [Run tests](#run-tests)

Found an issue? Please [let us know][sdk-bug]{:.external}.

## 1. Prerequisites {:#prerequisites}

This guide requires that your host machine meets the following criteria:

*  A Linux machine. (**macOS** is not supported yet.)
*  Has at least 15 GB of storage space.
*  Supports [KVM][kvm]{:.external} (Kernel Virtual Machine) for running a
   [QEMU][qemu]{:.external}-based emulator.
*  IPv6 is enabled.
*  [Git][git-install]{:.external} is installed.

## 2. Clone the SDK samples repository {:#clone-the-sdk-samples-repository}

Clone the [SDK samples repository][sdk-samples-repo]{:.external} on your host machine.
This repository contains the Bazel-based Fuchsia SDK and sample components.

Note: Support for installing the SDK by itself, without a samples repository, is planned.
See [this ticket][ticket-01].

The tasks include:

*   Bootstrap the SDK samples repository.
*   Build the SDK tools to initialize the SDK environment.
*   Verify that you can run [`ffx`][ffx] commands.

Do the following:

1. In a terminal, change to your home directory:

   Note: This guide uses the home directory (`$HOME`) as a base directory. This is where a new
   work directory (`fuchsia-getting-started`) will be created for this guide. You may also select
   a different base directory (for instance, `cd $HOME/my-fuchsia-project`).

   ```posix-terminal
   cd $HOME
   ```

1. Clone the Fuchsia samples repository:

   ```posix-terminal
   git clone https://fuchsia.googlesource.com/sdk-samples/getting-started fuchsia-getting-started --recurse-submodules
   ```

   This creates a new directory named `fuchsia-getting-started`, which clones the content of
   the SDK samples repository.

1. Go to the new directory:

   ```posix-terminal
   cd fuchsia-getting-started
   ```

1. Run the bootstrap script to install Bazel and other required dependencies:

   ```posix-terminal
   scripts/bootstrap.sh
   ```

1. Build the SDK tools:

   ```posix-terminal
   tools/bazel build @fuchsia_sdk//:fuchsia_toolchain_sdk
   ```

   The first build may take a few minutes to download dependencies, such as Bazel build rules,
   [Clang][clang]{:.external} and [Fuchsia IDK][fuchsia-idk] (which includes the `ffx` tool).

   When finished successfully, it prints output similar to the following in the end:

   ```none {:.devsite-disable-click-to-copy}
   $ tools/bazel build @fuchsia_sdk//:fuchsia_toolchain_sdk
   Starting local Bazel server and connecting to it...
   INFO: Analyzed target @fuchsia_sdk//:fuchsia_toolchain_sdk (2 packages loaded, 2 targets configured).
   INFO: Found 1 target...
   Target @fuchsia_sdk//:fuchsia_toolchain_sdk up-to-date (nothing to build)
   INFO: Elapsed time: 26.344s, Critical Path: 0.02s
   INFO: 1 process: 1 internal.
   INFO: Build completed successfully, 1 total action
   ```

1. To verify that you can use the `ffx` tool in your environment,
   run the following command:

   ```posix-terminal
   tools/ffx sdk version
   ```

   This command prints output similar to the following:

   ```none {:.devsite-disable-click-to-copy}
   $ tools/ffx sdk version
   9.20220807.3.1
   ```

   At this point, you only need to confirm that you can run `ffx` commands
   without error. (However for your information, the output above shows the version
   `9.20220807.3.1`, which indicates that this SDK was built and published on August 7, 2022.)

   Note: To ensure that you’re using the right version of `ffx` during development,
   consider updating your `PATH` to include the SDK's `tools` directory
   (for instance, `export PATH="$PATH:$HOME/fuchsia-getting-started/tools"`). However,
   if you don't wish to update your `PATH`, ensure that you specify the relative path to
   this `ffx` tool (`tools/ffx`) whenever you run `ffx` commands.

## 3. Start the emulator {:#start-the-emulator}

Start the [Fuchsia emulator][femu] on the host machine. This guide uses an instance
of the Fuchsia emulator as the target device for running and testing Fuchsia
software. And to be able to supply new Fuchsia software to the target device,
you also need to start the [Fuchsia package server][fuchsia-package-server]
on the host machine.

The tasks include:

*   Download one of Fuchsia's prebuilt images from Google Cloud Storage.
*   Start the Fuchsia emulator to run the downloaded Fuchsia prebuilt image.
*   Set the emulator instance as the default target device.
*   Verify that various `ffx` commands can connect to the emulator instance.
*   Start the Fuchsia package server.
*   Register the system package repository to the emulator instance.

Do the following:

1. Download the latest Fuchsia Workstation prebuilt image for the emulator
   (`workstation_eng.qemu-x64`):

   ```posix-terminal
   tools/ffx product-bundle get workstation_eng.qemu-x64 --repository workstation-packages
   ```

   This command may take a few minutes to download the image and product metadata.

   Note: If the `product-bundle` command fails with an error due to multiple product bundle
   instances or SDK versions, [clean up the environment](#clean-up-the-environment) before
   proceeding.

   Once the download is finished, the `ffx product-bundle get` command creates
   a local Fuchsia package repository named `workstation-packages` on your host machine.
   This package repository hosts additional system packages for this Workstation prebuilt image.
   Later in Step 12 you’ll register this package repository to the emulator instance.

1. Stop all running emulator instances:

   ```posix-terminal
   tools/ffx emu stop --all
   ```

1. Start a new Fuchsia emulator instance:

   ```posix-terminal
   tools/ffx emu start workstation_eng.qemu-x64 --headless
   ```

   This command starts a headless emulator instance running the Workstation prebuilt image.

   When the instance is up and running, the command prints output similar to the
   following:

   ```none {:.devsite-disable-click-to-copy}
   $ tools/ffx emu start workstation_eng.qemu-x64 --headless
   Creating SSH key pair: /home/alice/.ssh/fuchsia_ed25519
   Writing authorized_keys file: /home/alice/.ssh/fuchsia_authorized_keys
   Logging to "/home/alice/.local/share/Fuchsia/ffx/emu/instances/fuchsia-emulator/emulator.log"
   Waiting for Fuchsia to start (up to 60 seconds)...........
   Emulator is ready.
   ```

1. Verify that the new emulator instance is running:

   ```posix-terminal
   tools/ffx emu list
   ```

   This command prints output similar to the following:

   ```none {:.devsite-disable-click-to-copy}
   $ tools/ffx emu list
   [Active]    fuchsia-emulator
   ```

1. Verify that the emulator instance is detected as a device:

   ```posix-terminal
   tools/ffx target list
   ```

   This command prints output similar to the following:

   ```none {:.devsite-disable-click-to-copy}
   $ tools/ffx target list
   NAME                SERIAL       TYPE                        STATE      ADDRS/IP            RCS
   fuchsia-emulator    <unknown>    Unknown                     Product    [172.16.243.142]    Y
   ```

1. Set this emulator instance to be the default device:

   ```posix-terminal
   tools/ffx target default set fuchsia-emulator
   ```

   This command exits silently without output.


1. Verify that the default device is set:

   ```
   tools/ffx target default get
   ```

   This command prints output similar to the following:


   ```none {:.devsite-disable-click-to-copy}
   $ tools/ffx target default get
   fuchsia-emulator
   ```

1. To verify that you can establish an SSH connection to the emulator instance,
   run the following command:

   Note: To retrieve detailed device information, the `ffx target show` command uses
   [Fuchsia-specific SSH keys](#generate-fuchsia-specific-ssh-keys) to make an SSH
   connection to the device.

   ```posix-terminal
   tools/ffx target show
   ```

   This command prints output similar to the following:

   ```none {:.devsite-disable-click-to-copy}
   $ tools/ffx target show
   Target:
       Name: "fuchsia-emulator"
       SSH Address: "127.0.0.1:42577"
   Board:
       Name: "default-board"
       Revision: "1"
       Instruction set: "x64"
   Device:
       ...
   Build:
       Version: "9.20220807.3.1"
       Product: "workstation_eng"
       Board: "qemu-x64"
       Commit: "2022-08-07T20:02:13+00:00"
   Last Reboot:
       Graceful: "false"
       Reason: "Cold"
   ...
   ```

   The example output above shows that the target device is running a
   `workstation_eng.qemu-x64` prebuilt image whose version is `9.20220807.3.1`.

1. Verify that you can stream the device logs:

   ```posix-terminal
   tools/ffx log
   ```

   This command prints output similar to the following:

   ```none {:.devsite-disable-click-to-copy}
   $ tools/ffx log
   ...
   [33.698][core/cobalt][cobalt,fidl_service,core][I] LocalAggregation: Enabling local aggregation.

   ...
   ```

   Press `CTRL+C` to exit.

1. Start the Fuchsia package server:

   ```posix-terminal
   tools/ffx repository server start
   ```

   This command prints output similar to the following:

   ```none {:.devsite-disable-click-to-copy}
   $ tools/ffx repository server start
   ffx repository server is listening on [::]:8083
   ```

1. Check the list of Fuchsia package repositories available on
   your host machine:

   ```posix-terminal
   tools/ffx repository list
   ```

   This command prints output similar to the following:

   ```none {:.devsite-disable-click-to-copy}
   $ tools/ffx repository list
   +-----------------------+------+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
   | NAME                  | TYPE | EXTRA                                                                                           |

   +-----------------------+------+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
   ```

   Notice a package repository (`workstation-packages`) is created
   for the Workstation prebuilt image.

1. Register the `workstation-packages` package repository to the target device:

   ```posix-terminal
   tools/ffx target repository register -r workstation-packages --alias fuchsia.com
   ```

   This command exits silently without output.

## 4. Build and run the sample component {:#build-and-run-the-sample-component}

Build and run the [C++ Hello World component][hello-world-component]{:.external}
included in the SDK samples repository. [Components][fuchsia-component] are the basic
unit of executable software on Fuchsia.

The tasks include:

*   Build and run the sample Hello World component.
*   Make a change to the component.
*   Repeat the build and run steps.
*   Verify the change.

Do the following:

1. Build and run the sample component:

   ```posix-terminal
   tools/bazel run --config=fuchsia_x64 //src/hello_world:pkg.component
   ```
   When the build is successful, this command generates build artifacts in a temporary
   Fuchsia package repository, which is then removed after the component runs.

   The command prints output similar to the following:

   ```none {:.devsite-disable-click-to-copy}
   $ tools/bazel run --config=fuchsia_x64 //src/hello_world:pkg.component
   INFO: Build options --copt, --cpu, --crosstool_top, and 1 more have changed, discarding analysis cache.

   Starting component instance...
   Success! The component instance has been started.
   ```

1. Check the status of the `hello_world` component:

   ```posix-terminal
   tools/ffx component show hello_world
   ```

   This command prints output similar to the following:

   ```none {:.devsite-disable-click-to-copy}
   $ tools/ffx component show hello_world
                  Moniker:  /core/ffx-laboratory:hello_world
                      URL:  fuchsia-pkg://bazel.pkg.component/hello_world#meta/hello_world.cm
              Instance ID:  None
                     Type:  CML Component
          Component State:  Resolved
    Incoming Capabilities:  /svc/fuchsia.logger.LogSink
     Exposed Capabilities:
              Merkle root:  8575a55f5b894b0ca284786bf0f6c80f09a26d9a3a53157b4826a210d2f58f20
          Execution State:  Stopped
   ```

   The output shows that the `hello_world` component has run and is now terminated (`Stopped`).

1. Verify the `Hello, World!` message in the device logs:

   ```posix-terminal
   tools/ffx log --filter hello_world dump
   ```

   This command prints output similar to the following:

   ```none {:.devsite-disable-click-to-copy}
   $ tools/ffx log --filter hello_world dump
   ...

   {{ '<strong>' }}[core/ffx-laboratory:hello_world][][I] Hello, World!{{ '</strong>' }}
   ```

1. Use a text editor to edit the  `src/hello_world/hello_world.cc` file, for example:

   ```posix-terminal
   nano src/hello_world/hello_world.cc
   ```

1. Change the message to `"Hello again, World!"`.

   The `main()` method should look like below:

   ```none {:.devsite-disable-click-to-copy}
   int main() {
     {{ '<strong>' }}std::cout << "Hello again, World!\n";{{ '</strong>' }}
     return 0;
   }
   ```

1. Save the file and exit the text editor.

1. Build and run the sample component again:

   ```posix-terminal
   tools/bazel run --config=fuchsia_x64 //src/hello_world:pkg.component
   ```

1. Verify the `Hello again, World!` message in the device logs:

   ```posix-terminal
   tools/ffx log --filter hello_world dump
   ```

   This command prints output similar to the following;

   ```none {:.devsite-disable-click-to-copy}

   {{ '<strong>' }}[core/ffx-laboratory:hello_world][][I] Hello again, World!{{ '</strong>' }}
   ```

## 5. View symbolized logs {:#view-symbolized-logs}

Examine the [symbolized logs][symbolize-logs] (that is, human readable
stack traces) of a crashed component.

The tasks include:

*   Update the sample component to crash when it's started.
*   Build and run the sample component, which generates and registers the debug symbols
    of the component.
*   Verify that the crashed component's logs are in symbolized format.

Do the following:

1. Use a text editor to edit the  `src/hello_world/hello_world.cc` file, for example:

   ```posix-terminal
   nano src/hello_world/hello_world.cc
   ```

1. Just above the line `return 0;`, add the following line:

   ```
   abort();
   ```

   The `main()` method should look like below:

   ```none {:.devsite-disable-click-to-copy}
   int main() {
     std::cout << "Hello again, World!\n";
     {{ '<strong>' }}abort();{{ '</strong>' }}
     return 0;
   }
   ```

   This update will cause the component to crash immediately after printing a message.

1. Save the file and exit the text editor.

1. Build and run the sample component:

   ```posix-terminal
   tools/bazel run --config=fuchsia_x64 //src/hello_world:pkg.component
   ```

   Building a component automatically generates and registers the component’s debug
   symbols in your development environment.

1. For newly registered symbols to be used in your environment, restart the `ffx` daemon:

   Note: This is a temporary workaround. This issue is being tracked in
   [Issue 94614][ticket-94614]{:.external}.

   ```posix-terminal
   tools/ffx daemon stop
   ```

   A new instance of the `ffx `daemon starts the next time you run a `ffx` command.

1. Verify that the sample component's crash stack is symbolized in the kernel logs:

   ```posix-terminal
   tools/ffx log --kernel
   ```

   This command prints output similar to the following:

   ```none {:.devsite-disable-click-to-copy}
   $ tools/ffx log --kernel
   ...

   ```

   Verify that the lines in the kernel logs show the exact filenames and line numbers (for example,
   `main() src/hello_world/hello_world.cc:9`) that might've caused the component to crash.

   Press `CTRL+C` to exit.

## 6. Debug the sample component {:#debug-the-sample-component}

Launch the Fuchsia debugger ([`zxdb`][fuchsia-debugger]) for debugging the sample
component, which is now updated to crash when it's started.

The tasks include:

*   Start the Fuchsia debugger and connect it to the emulator instance.
*   Attach the debugger to the sample component.
*   Set a breakpoint.
*   Run the sample component and step through the code.

Do the following:

1. Start the Fuchsia debugger:

   ```posix-terminal
   tools/ffx debug connect
   ```

   This command automatically connects the debugger to the default target
   device, which is the emulator instance.

   When connected to the device, this command starts the `zxdb` terminal, for example:

   ```none {:.devsite-disable-click-to-copy}
   $ tools/ffx debug connect
   Connecting (use "disconnect" to cancel)...
   Connected successfully.
   👉 To get started, try "status" or "help".
   [zxdb]
   ```

1. In the `zxdb` terminal, attach the debugger to the `hello_world.cm` component:

  <pre class="devsite-click-to-copy">
  <span class="no-select">[zxdb] </span>attach hello_world.cm
  </pre>

   This command prints output similar to the following:

   ```none {:.devsite-disable-click-to-copy}
   [zxdb] attach hello_world.cm
   Waiting for process matching "hello_world.cm".
   Type "filter" to see the current filters.
   ```

1. In the `zxdb` terminal, set a breakpoint at the `main()` method:

  <pre class="devsite-click-to-copy">
  <span class="no-select">[zxdb] </span>break main
  </pre>

   This command prints output similar to the following:

   ```none {:.devsite-disable-click-to-copy}
   [zxdb] break main
   Created Breakpoint 1 @ main
   Pending: No current matches for location. It will be matched against new
            processes and shared libraries.
   ```

1. In a different terminal, run the sample component:

   Note: In this new terminal, make sure that you change to the same work
   directory (for instance,  `cd $HOME/fuchsia-getting-started`).

   ```posix-terminal
   tools/bazel run --config=fuchsia_x64 //src/hello_world:pkg.component
   ```

   In the `zxdb` terminal, the sample component is paused
   at the breakpoint:

   ```none {:.devsite-disable-click-to-copy}
   Attached Process 1 state=Running koid=17658651 name=hello_world.cm
   Downloading symbols...
   Breakpoint 1 now matching 1 addrs for main
   Could not load symbols for "<vDSO>" because there was no mapping for build ID "1dbd2861a642d61b".
   Symbol downloading complete. 0 succeeded, 1 failed.
   🛑 on bp 1, 2 main() • hello_world.cc:8

       7 int main() {
    ▶  8   std::cout << "Hello again, World!\n";
       9   abort();
      10   return 0;
   [zxdb]
   ```

   Note: You can re-build and re-run your component as many times as you want, but do not need to
   restart the debugger or run `attach` again. The debugger will preserve your breakpoints and
   continue watching for future processes called `hello_world.cm`.

1. In the new terminal, monitor device logs for the `hello_world` component:

   ```posix-terminal
   tools/ffx log --filter hello_world
   ```

   This comment prints output similar to the following:

   ```none {:.devsite-disable-click-to-copy}
   $ tools/ffx log --filter hello_world
   ...
   [pkg-resolver][pkg-resolver][I] Fetching blobs for fuchsia-pkg://bazel.pkg.component/hello_world: [

   ```

   Notice the `Hello again, World!` line is not printed yet.

1. In the `zxdb` terminal, use `next` to step through the code:

  <pre class="devsite-click-to-copy">
  <span class="no-select">[zxdb] </span>next
  </pre>

   In the `zxdb` terminal, the code get executed line by line, for
   example:

   ```none {:.devsite-disable-click-to-copy}
   ...
   🛑 on bp 1 main() • hello_world.cc:8
       6 
       7 int main() {
    ▶  8   std::cout << "Hello again, World!\n";
       9   abort();
      10   return 0;
   [zxdb] {{ '<strong>'}}next{{ '</strong>'}}
   🛑 main() • hello_world.cc:9
       7 int main() {
       8   std::cout << "Hello again, World!\n";
    ▶  9   abort();
      10   return 0;
      11 }
   ```

   In the device logs terminal, verify that the `Hello again, World!` line is
   now printed:

   ```none {:.devsite-disable-click-to-copy}
   [core/ffx-laboratory:hello_world][][I] Hello again, World!
   ```

1. To exit the `zxdb` terminal, type `exit` or press `Ctrl-D`.

   This causes the component to finish the execution of the rest of the code.

   Note: For more information on usages and best practices on `zxdb`, see the
   [zxdb user guide][zxdb-user-guide].

## 7. Inspect components {:#inspect-components}

Retrieve a component's data exposed by Fuchsia's Inspect API. This data can be any
set of specialized information that a Fuchsia component is programmed to collect
while it is running on the device.

Note: For a component to collect and expose inspect data, the implementation
of inspect operations and data types must be placed in the component’s code.
Developers use this inspect feature to collect and expose information that will be
helpful for debugging the component or the system. For details,
see [Fuchsia component inspection overview][inspect-overview].

The tasks include:

*   Scan the list of components on the device that expose inspect data (for
    example, the `bootstrap/archivist` component).
*   Scan the list of selectors provided by the `bootstrap/archivist` component.
*   Inspect a specific set of data from the `bootstrap/archivist` component.

Do the following:

1. View the list of components on the device that expose inspect data:

   ```posix-terminal
   tools/ffx inspect list
   ```

   This command prints output similar to the following:

   ```none {:.devsite-disable-click-to-copy}
   $ tools/ffx inspect list
   <component_manager>
   bootstrap/archivist
   bootstrap/driver_manager
   bootstrap/fshost
   bootstrap/fshost/blobfs
   bootstrap/fshost/fxfs
   ...
   core/ui/scenic
   core/vulkan_loader
   core/wlancfg
   core/wlandevicemonitor
   core/wlanstack
   ```

   Notice that the `bootstrap/archivist` component is on the list.

1. View all available selectors for the `bootstrap/archivist` component:

   ```posix-terminal
   tools/ffx inspect selectors bootstrap/archivist
   ```

   This command prints output similar to the following:

   ```none {:.devsite-disable-click-to-copy}
   $ tools/ffx inspect selectors bootstrap/archivist
   bootstrap/archivist:root/archive_accessor_stats/all/inspect/batch_iterator/get_next:errors
   bootstrap/archivist:root/archive_accessor_stats/all/inspect/batch_iterator/get_next:requests
   bootstrap/archivist:root/archive_accessor_stats/all/inspect/batch_iterator/get_next:responses
   ...
   ```

   Each of these selectors represents a different type of data you can inspect.

1. Inspect the `bootstrap/archivist` component for the recent events data:

   ```posix-terminal
   tools/ffx inspect show bootstrap/archivist:root/events/recent_events
   ```

   This command prints output similar to the following:

   ```none {:.devsite-disable-click-to-copy}
   $ tools/ffx inspect show bootstrap/archivist:root/events/recent_events
   bootstrap/archivist:
     metadata:
       filename = fuchsia.inspect.Tree
       component_url = fuchsia-boot:///#meta/archivist.cm
       timestamp = 705335717538
     payload:
       root:
         events:
           recent_events:
             361:
               @time = 6272744049
               event = component_stopped
               moniker = core/trace_manager/cpuperf_provider
             362:
               @time = 6283370267
               event = log_sink_requested
               moniker = core/session-manager
             ...
             556:
               @time = 415796882099
               event = log_sink_requested
               moniker = core/debug_agent
             557:
               @time = 453898419738
               event = component_started
               moniker = core/ffx-laboratory:hello_world
             558:
               @time = 453899964568
               event = log_sink_requested
               moniker = core/ffx-laboratory:hello_world
             559:
               @time = 453900332656
               event = log_sink_requested
               moniker = core/ffx-laboratory:hello_world
             560:
               @time = 495458923475
               event = component_stopped
               moniker = core/ffx-laboratory:hello_world
   ```

   This data records all the events triggered by components on the device so far.

## 8. Run tests {:#run-tests}

Run tests on the device by launching test components, which are included
in the [SDK samples repository][sdk-samples-repo]{:.external}.

The tasks include:

*   Build and run the sample test components.
*   Update one of the tests to fail.
*   Verify the failure in the test results.

Do the following:

1. Build and run the sample test components:

   ```posix-terminal
   tools/bazel test --config=fuchsia_x64 --test_output=all //src/hello_world:test_pkg
   ```

   This command runs all the tests in the Hello World component’s test package
   ([`hello_world:test_pkg`][hello-world-test-package]{:.external}).

   The command prints output similar to the following:

   ```none {:.devsite-disable-click-to-copy}
   $ tools/bazel test --config=fuchsia_x64 --test_output=all //src/hello_world:test_pkg
   INFO: Analyzed target //src/hello_world:test_pkg (10 packages loaded, 568 targets configured).

   Executed 1 out of 1 test: 1 test passes.
   INFO: Build completed successfully, 105 total actions
   ```

1. Use a text editor to edit the `src/hello_world/hello_gtest.cc` file, for example:

   ```posix-terminal
   nano src/hello_world/hello_gtest.cc
   ```

1. Replace `EXPECT_STRNE()` with `EXPECT_STREQ()`:

   The test should look like below:

   ```none {:.devsite-disable-click-to-copy}
   TEST(HelloTest, BasicAssertions) {
     std::cout << "Example stdout." << std::endl;

     // Expect two strings not to be equal.
     {{ '<strong>' }}EXPECT_STREQ("hello", "world");{{ '</strong>' }}
     // Expect equality.
     EXPECT_EQ(7 * 6, 42);
   }
   ```

   This change will cause the [GoogleTest][google-test]{:.external} (`hello_gtest`)
   to fail.

1. Save the file and exit the text editor.

1. To verify that the updated test now fails, build and run the `hello_gtest` component:

   ```posix-terminal
   tools/bazel test --config=fuchsia_x64 --test_output=all //src/hello_world:test_pkg.hello_gtest
   ```

   This command prints output similar to the following:

   ```none {:.devsite-disable-click-to-copy}

**Congratulations! You're now all set with the Fuchsia SDK!**

## Next steps {:#next-steps}

Learn more about the Fuchsia platform and tools in [Fuchsia SDK Fundamentals][fundamentals].

## Appendices

### Clean up the environment {:#clean-up-the-environment}

If you run into a problem while following this guide and decide to start over
from the beginning, consider running the commands below to clean up
your development environment (that is, to clean up directories, build artifacts,
downloaded files, symlinks, configuration settings, and more).

Remove the package repositories created in this guide:

```posix-terminal
tools/ffx repository remove workstation-packages
```

```posix-terminal
tools/ffx repository server stop
```

Remove all existing configurations and data of `ffx`:

```posix-terminal
tools/ffx daemon stop
```

```posix-terminal
rm -rf $HOME/.local/share/Fuchsia/ffx
```

When Bazel fails to build, try the commands below:

Caution: Running `bazel clean` or deleting the `$HOME/.cache/bazel` directory
deletes all the artifacts downloaded by Bazel, which can be around 4 GB.
This means Bazel will need to download those dependencies again
the next time you run `bazel build`.

```posix-terminal
tools/bazel clean --expunge
```

```posix-terminal
tools/bazel shutdown && rm -rf $HOME/.cache/bazel
```

Remove the `fuchsia-getting-started` directory and its artifacts:

Caution: If the SDK samples repository is cloned to a different location
than `$HOME/fuchsia-getting-started`, adjust the directory path in the command
below. Be extremely careful with the directory path when you run the
`rm -rf <DIR>` command.

```posix-terminal
rm -rf $HOME/fuchsia-getting-started
```

Other clean up commands:

```posix-terminal
killall ffx
```

```posix-terminal
killall pm
```

### Update the firewall rules {:#update-the-firewall-rules}

When you launch the sample component (for instance, using the command `tools/bazel run`),
you might run into an issue where the command hangs for a long time and
eventually fails with the following error:

```none {:.devsite-disable-click-to-copy}
Lifecycle protocol could not start the component instance: InstanceCannotResolve
```

In that case, you may need to update the firewall rules on your host machine.

If you’re using the `ufw` firewall, run the following commands:

```posix
sudo ufw allow proto tcp from fe80::/10 to any port 8083 comment 'Fuchsia Package Server'
```

```posix
sudo ufw allow proto tcp from fc00::/7 to any port 8083 comment 'Fuchsia Package Server'
```

However, for other non-`ufw`-based firewalls, you will need to ensure that port 8083
is available for the Fuchsia package server.
