# Protocol capabilities

<<../../_v2_banner.md>>

A [protocol capability][glossary.protocol-capability] allows
components to connect to [FIDL protocols][glossary.protocol]
provided either by other components or the component framework itself.

Note: _Protocol_ and _service_ capabilities are distinct types of
capabilities. A protocol represents a single instance of a
[FIDL protocols][glossary.protocol], while a service represents zero or
more instances of a [FIDL service][glossary.service].
See the documentation on [service capabilities][service-capability]
for more details.

## Providing protocol capabilities {#provide}

To provide a protocol capability, a component must define the capability and
[route](#route) it from `self`. The component hosts the
protocol capability in its FIDL [outgoing directory][glossary.outgoing-directory].

To define the capability, add a `capabilities` declaration for it:

```json5
{
    capabilities: [
        {
            protocol: "fuchsia.example.ExampleProtocol",
        },
    ],
}
```

This defines a capability hosted by this component whose outgoing directory path
is `/svc/fuchsia.example.ExampleProtocol`. You can also customize the path:

```json5
{
    capabilities: [
        {
            protocol: "fuchsia.example.ExampleProtocol",
            path: "/my_svc/fuchsia.example.MyExampleProtocol",
        },
    ],
}
```

## Routing protocol capabilities {#route}

Components route protocol capabilities by [exposing](#expose) them to their
parent and [offering](#offer) them to their children.

### Exposing {#expose}

Exposing a protocol capability gives the component's parent access to that
capability. This is done through an [`expose`][expose] declaration.

```json5
{
    expose: [
        {
            protocol: "fuchsia.example.ExampleProtocol",
            from: "self",
        },
    ],
}
```

The `from: "self"` directive means that the protocol capability is provided by
this component. In this case the protocol must have a corresponding
[definition](#provide).

### Offering {#offer}

Offering a protocol capability gives a child component access to that capability.
This is done through an [`offer`][offer] declaration.

```json5
{
    offer: [
        {
            protocol: "fuchsia.example.ExampleProtocol",
            from: "self",
            to: [ "#child-a", "#child_b" ],
        },
    ],
}
```

## Consuming protocol capabilities {#consume}

When a component [uses][use] a protocol capability that has been [offered][offer]
to it, that protocol is made available through the component's
[namespace][glossary.namespace].

Consider a component with the following manifest declaration:

```
{
    use: [
        {
            protocol: "fuchsia.example.ExampleProtocol",
        },
    ],
}
```

When the component attempts to open the path
`/svc/fuchsia.example.ExampleProtocol`, the component framework performs
[capability routing][capability-routing] to find the component that provides
this protocol. Then, the framework connects the newly opened channel to this
provider.

You can also customize the namespace path:

```json5
{
    use: [
        {
            protocol: "fuchsia.example.ExampleProtocol",
            path: "/my_svc/fuchsia.example.MyExampleProtocol",
        },
    ],
}
```

[life of a protocol open][life-of-a-protocol-open].

Note: For a working example of routing a protocol capability between components,
see [`//examples/components/routing`][routing-example].

## Protocol capabilities provided by the framework

Some protocol capabilities are provided by the component framework, and thus
can be [used][use] by components without their parents [offering][offer] them.

For a list of these protocols and what they can be used for, see
[framework protocols][framework-protocols].

```json5
{
    use: [
        {
            protocol: "fuchsia.sys2.Realm",
            from: "framework",
        },
    ],
}
```
