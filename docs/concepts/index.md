# About Fuchsia

You can learn more about Fuchsia by diving deeper into the concepts driving its
design. Fuchsia  is still evolving rapidly, but the underlying principles and
values of the system have remained relatively constant throughout the project. 

## Principles

The core principles guiding Fuchsiaâ€™s design and development are simple, secure,
updatable, and performant.

### Simple

Fuchsia makes it easy to create, maintain, and integrate software and hardware
across a wide range of devices.

### Secure

Fuchsia has a kernel and software model designed for modern computing.

### Updatable

As a modular operating system, Fuchsia allows the kernel, drivers, and software
components to be independently updatable.

### Performant

Fuchsia is designed for real world product requirements and optimized for
performance.
