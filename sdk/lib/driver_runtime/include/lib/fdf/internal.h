// Usage Notes:
//
// Usage of this API is restricted to the Driver Framework's V1 driver host.
// This is used to update the driver runtime of the current driver context
// that the driver host thread is in.
//
// Example:
//
// void some_op(zx_driver_t* driver) {
//   fdf_runtime_push_driver(driver);

//   // Dispatch driver operation.
//   ...
//
//   fdf_runtime_pop_driver();
// }
//

// on the thread of the final dispatcher which has been shutdown.
//
// after all dispatcher's shutdown observers have had their handlers called.
// While a driver is shutting down, no new dispatchers can be created by the driver.
//
// If this succeeds, you must keep the |observer| object alive until the
// |observer| is notified.
//
// Returns ZX_OK if successful and |observer| will be notified.
// Returns ZX_ERR_INVALID_ARGS if no driver matching |driver| was found.
// Returns ZX_ERR_BAD_STATE if a driver shutdown observer was already registered.
