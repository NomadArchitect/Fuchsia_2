/// A mixer Graph.
///
/// ## Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs)
///
/// Each graph includes a set of nodes connected into one or more DAGs. Audio
/// data flows from Producer nodes to Consumer nodes, and in between, may flow
/// through processing nodes, including Mixers, Splitters, and Custom nodes.
///
/// Each node has zero or more incoming and outgoing edges. Each edge represents
/// a single stream of audio data. Incoming edges are called "source streams"
/// and outgoing edges are called "destination streams".
///
/// Audio is strongly typed: each node declares the audio format(s) it can
/// ingest from source streams and the audio format(s) it can produce to
/// destination streams. It is illegal to connect nodes with incompatible
/// encodings.
///
/// ## Execution Model
///
/// Execution is driven by Consumers. Each Consumer wakes every N ms (N is
/// configurable per Consumer) and pulls N ms of audio from its sources, which
/// pull audio from their sources, and so on, up to the connected Producers. As
/// audio is pulled down the graph, it is processed and mixed into a single
/// stream that is written into the Consumer.
///
/// Each Consumer is attached to a Thread, which gives the Consumer a place to
/// do its work. Threads usually need deadline profiles to meet real-time
/// constraints. The client is responsible for creating Thread objects,
/// assigning Consumers to Threads, and attaching appropriate deadline profiles
/// when needed.
///
/// When the DAG includes nodes with multiple outgoing edges, such as Splitters,
/// we can end up in a situation where two Consumers A and B share the same
/// dependencies (via the Splitter's source). If A and B run on different
/// threads, it's unclear which Thread should process those shared dependencies,
/// making it unclear how much deadline capacity is required by each thread. To
/// avoid this problem, we partition the DAG so that each Consumer is the root
/// of an inverted tree. At nodes with multiple outgoing edges, such as
/// Splitters, we partition the node into a hidden Consumer node (which drives
/// the sources) and hidden Producer nodes (which drive the destinations). When
/// the client creates a Splitter, they must assign a Thread to the Splitter's
/// hidden Consumer. This ensures that each node is processed on a unique
/// thread, making it simpler to analyze the needed capacity for each Thread.
///
/// ## Method Semantics
///
/// Methods will be executed sequentially in the order they are called. Method
/// calls can be pipelined, but if more than an implementation-defined number of
/// requests are in flight at one time, the server reserves the right to assume
/// a DoS attack and close the connection.
///
/// Most methods use a minimal set of arguments plus an "options" table to allow
/// for extensibility.
///
/// ## IDs and names
///
/// Every object is identified by a numeric `id`. Within each object type
/// (Nodes, Threads, and GainControls) IDs are guaranteed to be unique. Old IDs
/// for deleted objects will never be reused for new objects.
///
/// Every object has an optional string `name`. If specified, ideally this name
/// should be unique within the [`Graph`] and have a printable CamelCase format,
/// but uniqueness is not required. Names are used for developer-visible
/// diagnostics only -- they do not need to be unique. Duplicate names can at
/// worst lead to potentially-confusing diagnostics. IDs, not names, should be
/// used when unique identification is required.
///
/// ## Clocks
///
/// Each audio stream is associated with a *reference clock*. Different streams
/// can use different clocks. Any two clocks can differ in both value (the
/// current time) and the rate, where the rate may [change over
/// time](https://fuchsia.dev/fuchsia-src/reference/syscalls/clock_update) as
/// long as the clock remains [continuous and
/// monotonic](https://fuchsia.dev/fuchsia-src/reference/kernel_objects/clock).
/// This reflects many real situations. For example, a speaker may have an
/// internal clock separate from the CPU's physical clock. Or, a stream may
/// originate from some other computer on the network whose clock is not
/// precisely synchronized to our local clock.
///
/// Every node must specify the reference clock used by the node's destination
/// streams, except for Consumers, which must specify a clock for the Consumer's
/// source stream. To connect two streams that use different clocks, we must
/// translate one stream onto the other stream's clock. This is done at Mixer
/// nodes, which use sample rate conversion (SRC) to translate source streams
/// onto the Mixer's destination reference clock.
///
/// Reference clocks can change rate over time. These rate changes are typically
/// controlled by the client. If the client doesn't need precise control over
/// reference clocks, a cheaper option is to use Graph-controlled clocks (see
/// [`Graph.CreateGraphControlledReferenceClock`]), which can avoid a
/// potentially-expensive SRC in many cases. For example, if a Producer flows to
/// a Consumer, where the Producer uses a Graph-controlled clock and the
/// Consumer uses a client-controlled clock, the `Graph` will adjust the
/// Producer clock's rate to synchronize the Producer and Consumer clocks,
/// eliminating the need for SRC.
