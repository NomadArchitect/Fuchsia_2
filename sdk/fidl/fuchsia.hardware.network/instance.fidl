/// An instance of a network device that may be capable of MAC address filtering.
// NOTE(brunodalbo) This is a temporary solution to provide the two main protocols offered by the
// fuchsia.hardware.network library. This is the protocol exposed in devfs by devices that support
// its inner protocols. Device and MacAddressing will be composed differently in a post-unification
// world. The only clients for this protocol should be agents interested in enumerating networking
// devices, and they should refrain from passing this Hub service to netstack, but rather pass along
// fulfilled requests to the inner protocols.
