# A resource that can be used in CTS.
#
# An equivalent to the in-tree `resource`, but ensures dependencies are allowed
# in CTS.
#
# Example:
# ```
# cts_resource("my-bin") {
#  sources = [ "test_bins/my_bin" ]
#  outputs = [ "bin/my_bin" ]
# }
# ```
#
# Parameters
#   outputs
#     Required: List of one runtime path.  This must be a relative path (no
#     leading `/`).  It can use placeholders based on $sources; see copy()
#     and `gn help source_expansion`.
#     Type: list(path)
#
#   sources
#     Required: List of files in the source tree or build that become $outputs.
#     See copy() for details.
#     Type: list(file)
#
# See resource() for other parameters.
