# configured_by_assembly

This directory defines a package with a component that is packaged without the
structured configuration values it requires. The product assembly tool is able
to package these values as an example of integrating a platform package's
configuration into the assembly pipeline.

## Tests

See `//src/tests/assembly/structured_config`.
