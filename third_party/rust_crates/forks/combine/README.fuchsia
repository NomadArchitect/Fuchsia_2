# What is this crate used for?

At the time of writing, this crate is a dependency of https://docs.rs/toml_edit.

# Are there any use restrictions? i.e. only for development hosts

No.

# What differs from upstream?

This fork is using upstream commit 7f330b0cacd61131df88c919074ffa8136100299 from version
4.6.1-alpha.0 which had not been published to crates.io as 4.6.1 at the time of writing. The latest
version on crates.io at the time of writing was 4.6.0. Publication has been requested in
https://github.com/Marwes/combine/issues/320.

The version number in Cargo.toml was modified to remove the alpha suffix that prevented cargo from
resolving it for toml_edit's dependency. No other modifications have been made.

# Are there any restrictions to how it should be rolled?

No, although ideally we would delete this fork rather than continue updating it once upstream has
published to crates.io.

# Is there anything else which makes this dependency "special"?

No.
