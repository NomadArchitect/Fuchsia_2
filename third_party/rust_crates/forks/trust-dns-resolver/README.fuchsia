# What is this crate used for?

DNS resolution.

# Are there any use restrictions? i.e. only for development hosts

No.

# What differs from upstream?

This fork includes a short-term fix to issues tracked in
https://github.com/bluejekyll/trust-dns/issues/1702, which were not yet fixed upstream at the time
of writing.

# Are there any restrictions to how it should be rolled?

We should unfork and pull from upstream once that issue has been resolved in a new release of
trust-dns-resolver.

# Is there anything else which makes this dependency "special"?

No.
