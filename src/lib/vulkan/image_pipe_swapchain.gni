# simply depend on //src/lib/vulkan/swapchain:image_pipe_swapchain_layer or
# //src/lib/vulkan/swapchain:image_pipe_swapchain_xxx_layer instead,
# this will add both the loadable module, configuration JSON file and related
# dependencies.

# To use the image pipe swapchain layer in a package, add a dependency on
# //src/lib/vulkan/swapchain
# in the package, import this .gni file, and append the loadable_module and
# resources entries from this scope to the package's scope.
#
# Example BUILD.gn file:
#
# import("//src/lib/vulkan/image_pipe_swapchain.gni")
#
# package("funky_swap_chain_example") {
#   loadable_modules = [
#     ...
#     ] + image_pipe_swapchain.loadable_modules
