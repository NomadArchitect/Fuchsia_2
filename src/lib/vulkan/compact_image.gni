# To use the compact image layer in a package, add a dependency on
# //src/lib/vulkan/compact_image
# in the package, import this .gni file, and append the loadable_module and
# resources entries from this scope to the package's scope.
#
# Example BUILD.gn file:
#
# import("//src/lib/vulkan/compact_image.gni")
#
# package("funky_image_example") {
#   loadable_modules = [
#     ...
#     ] + compact_image.loadable_modules
#
#   resources = [
#     ...
#     ] + compact_image.resources
#
#   public_deps = [

#     ] + compact_image.public_deps
# }
