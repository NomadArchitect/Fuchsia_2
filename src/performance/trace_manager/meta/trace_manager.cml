    // TODO(fxbug.dev/104206): Having eager startup means that these providers
    // need to be included in the base package set along with trace_manager.
    //
    // A better way to do this would be via subpackages (RFC-0154:
    // Subpackages). This will allow us to configure these at compile time and
    // ensure they are always distributed with trace_manager when it expects to
    // have them.
