// is specified as tokens per seconds which is a double. This means that tokens can be issue at a
// rate lower than one token per second. The bucket has a capacity that is specified at
// construction. This causes tokens to build up to capacity and allow a burst of token to be issued
// in a short time before being limited by the token regeneration.
//
// In terms of implementation the bucket uses CPU ticks as currency to pay for tokens. The bucket
// accumulates currency as the CPU ticks. At construction the price (in ticks) for a token is
// computed and each time a token is requested the bucket will check to see if it has accumulated
// enough ticks since the last token was issued. If it has enough ticks the bucket will add the
// price of the token to the time the last token was issued, thereby consuming ticks.
