# RFCOMM PTS Instructions

## Setup
Tools used to pass RFCOMM tests in PTS:
* ACTS (see \<fuchsia_root\>/src/connectivity/bluetooth/docs/pts/acts_pts_setup.md)
    * Use the BluetoothCmdLineTest tool for all tests:
        * act.py -c \<config\> -tc BluetoothCmdLineTest
* SL4F (see \<fuchsia_root\>/src/testing/sl4f/README.md)
* bt-cli (see \<fuchsia_root\>/src/connectivity/bluetooth/tools/bt-cli)
* fx log

Notes:
* $PTS_ADDR is the integer address of the PTS Device. This can be found in bt-cli by doing:
  `bt-cli> list-devices`.
* Run `fx log --only test-rfcomm-client` to enable logging in a separate terminal. Relevant RFCOMM
  values will be printed in this log.
* Ensure the HFP component is not running. If `ps | grep hfp` returns a process, terminate it by
  running `killall bt-hfp-audio-gateway.cm`.

## IXIT Values
TSPX_bd_addr_iut = The address of your device

TSPX_server_channel_uit = The RFCOMM channel number that is advertised by the Fuchsia device. Use 1.
