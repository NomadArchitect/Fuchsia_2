// This time is expected to be:
//   a) sufficient to avoid flakes due to infra or resource contention, except in many standard
//      deviations of unlikeliness
//   b) short enough to still provide useful feedback in those cases where asynchronous operations
//      fail
//   c) short enough to fail before the overall infra-imposed test timeout (currently 5 minutes),
//      so that we can produce specific test-relevant information in the case of failure.
