# Gigaboot in C++

This folder contains source code for Fuchsia Gigaboot written in C++. It is built
using the physboot toolchain defined in `zircon/kernel/phys/efi/BUILD.gn`. The code
is currently under construction. It'll eventually replace the C gigaboot
implementation in the parent folder (b/235489025).
