Fxfs is a filesystem under active development. See the [RFC] for the motivation
and higher level design decisions.

Fxfs has rustdoc style documentation which can be generated and opened with
command like

```
fx rustdoc //src/storage/fxfs:lib --open
```

Note: The last line prints the documentation location, which depends on target.
