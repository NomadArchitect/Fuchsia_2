// Theory of operation of ShutdownManager:
//  There are a number of ways shutdown can be initiated:
//   - The process could be terminated, resulting in a signal from the Lifecycle channel
//   - The administrator interface could signal UnregisterSystemStorageForShutdown, or
//     SuspendWithoutExit
//   - Any of the three fidl connections could be dropped
//  If any of these evens happen, the shutdown procedure should be started, if it is not
//  already in progress.
//  The state transition table is then:
//
//  [kRunning]
//      |
//  StartShutdown <--- Some event that triggers shutdown
//     \|/
//  [kPackageStopping]---OnPackageShutdownComplete
//                                 \|/
//                            [kBootStopping] ----OnBootShutdownComplete
//                                                         \|/
//                                                     [kStopped]
//
//  OnPackageShutdownComplete and OnBootShutdownComplete are callbacks from the entity in charge
//  of shutting down drivers.  Shutdown triggering events that occur while shutdown is in progress
//  have no effect on the shutdown process, although some events may cause an error to be logged.
//  After shutting down the package and boot drivers, the system is signalled to stop in some
//  manner, dictated by what is set by SetTerminationSystemState.  The default state, which is
//  invoked if there is some error, is REBOOT.
//  Any errors in the shutdown process are logged, but ulimately do not stop the shutdown.
//  SetTerminationSystemState and SetMexecZbis are accepted in all stages except STOPPED
//  The ShutdownManager is not thread safe. It assumes that all channels will be dispatched
//  on the same single threaded dispatcher, and that all callbacks will also be called on
//  that same thread.
