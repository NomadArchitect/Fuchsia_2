# Purpose

The click recognizer detects a click on the touchpad, and discards all touchpad
events related to the click.

A click occurs when the user exerts enough force on the touchpad to move the pad itself. (This is distinct from a tap, which does not move the pad.)

Notably, this includes discarding any spurious motion that occurs during the click (when a button has been pressed but not yet released).

This recognizer is needed for feature parity with the ClickDragHandler thatâ€™s used in mouse mode.

# State machine

The click recognizer implements the state machine below.
