# This library is intended for use in tests, but is not marked as testonly
# because it is a dependency of component_manager::model::testing. That
# module is currently included in the main component_manager library
# (rather than being guarded with '#[cfg(test)]') to allow use in separate
# integration test targets.
# TODO(https://fxbug.dev/75967): mark this target as test-only.
