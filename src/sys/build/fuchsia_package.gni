# Defines a Fuchsia package.
# See: https://fuchsia.dev/fuchsia-src/development/components/build
#
# Fuchsia packages are a collection of any number of files (or resources), each
# with a unique path that is relative to the package's root.
# Package targets collect resources via their dependencies. These dependencies
# are typically fuchsia_component() targets, which provide their component
# manifest and other files that the component needs (such as an executable).
#
# Packages can be defined as a collection of pairs each representing a file in
# the package. Each pair consists of the path in the package that is assigned
# to the file, and a path relative to the build system's output directory where
# the contents of the file will be sourced from.
# This mapping is generated at build time, and is known as the package
# manifest.
#
# To view the package manifest, For instance assume you have defined
# a package at `path/to/project:my_package` and built it:
# ```
# $ fx build path/to/project:my_package
# ```
# You can then find the path to the generated manifest:
# ```
# $ fx gn outputs out/default path/to/project:my_package_manifest
# ```
#
# The package name is defined by the target name.
# Some rules apply to package names.
# See: https://fuchsia.dev/fuchsia-src/concepts/packages/package_url#package-name
#
# It's recommended for a package to depend on one or more `fuchsia_component()`
# targets. Typically no other dependencies are required.
#
# Example:
# ```
# fuchsia_package("my-package") {
#   deps = [
#     ":first_component",
#     ":second_component",
#   ]
# }
# ```
#
# Parameters
#
#   package_name (optional)
#     The name of the package.
#     Type: string
#     Default: target_name
#
#   disable_elf_binaries_checks (optional)
#     Set to true to disable ELF binaries verification checks. Useful
#     if your package includes non-Fuchsia ELF binaries, or if some
#     of them are unstripped.
#     Type: boolean
#     Default: false
#
#   deps
#   testonly
#   visibility
