// Provides a fake fuzz_coverage component, analogous to the one provided by test_manager.
//
// NOTE: Do not enable tests that include this component in coverage builds. In those builds,
// test_manager's debug_data component *also* exposes `fuchsia.debugdata.Publisher`, which is
// offered via the "test-env" environment's debug field. The component framework does not reliably
// route to this component, which can cause tests to flake.
