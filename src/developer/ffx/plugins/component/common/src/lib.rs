Wildcards may be used anywhere in the selector.

Example: 'remote-control:out:*' would return all services in 'out' for
the component remote-control.

Note that moniker wildcards are not recursive: 'a/*/c' will only match
components named 'c' running in some sub-realm directly below 'a', and
no further.";

Example:
'appmgr', 'appmgr.cm', 'fuchsia-pkg://fuchsia.com/appmgr#meta/appmgr.cm'
