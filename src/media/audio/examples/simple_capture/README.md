# Simple Capture Example

This directory contains an example application that shows, in simplest possible
implementation, how to capture audio via the lowest-layer FIDL protocols.

For usage of more advanced AudioCapturer features (such as usage of a reference
clock, or configuring gain), see the wav_recorder utility.
